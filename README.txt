Floppy10!

NOTE: This does not fully boot Windows 10. This is just a proof of concept.

Instructions
	(1) Download Floppy10
	(2) Run 'floppy.cmd'
	(3) Enter the path where you want to install Floppy10. This can be A:\, C:\F10, but not C:\
	because it emptys the folder where you want to install it. It will run rd C:\ /s /q which we don't
	want.
	(4) Enter the username you want to use. This can be anything, but don't use spaces. Replace spaces with and underscore (_).
	(5) Wait for it to install. This might take a second depending on the floppy disk.
	(6) Press a key. This will exit out of the installer. There we go!
